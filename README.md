# Mapping_Earthquakes

The intent of this project is to add further functionality to our existing earthquake map by adding a tectonic plate layer to further analyze the correlation between fault lines and earthquake magnitude and frequency. Our existing map is able to display earthquake magnitude and location as well as visualize the intensity through the use of color and radius point size. This interactive map will allow researchers to more easily browse through earthquake data and easily understand the data through colorful visualization.
